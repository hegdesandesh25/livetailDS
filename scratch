 - As of now copy and emit is happening in server.py where the items from list are being copied onto streams
 - streams do not have direct plugin from logstash
 - started seeing memory issues with Redis (might need to set eviction policy etc to handle better)
 - wsl was 2 GB, extended it to 4GB, still seeing memory issues set maxmemory in /etc/redis/redis.conf
 - allkeys-lru: This policy will evict the least recently used (LRU) keys from the entire dataset, including keys without an expiration set. It considers all keys, whether volatile or not.
 - maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru #cleared everything
